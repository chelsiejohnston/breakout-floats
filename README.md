# breakout-floats
A clunky little plugin for breaking pull-quote-style floats out of their containers. WIP.

On mobile, none of this should happen and everything's inline. 

If Javascript is disabled (use Modernizr to detect .js class on HTML element), don't break the floats out.

@todo: Unset vars so this can fire on debounced resize
